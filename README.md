  Web2LLM: Website to LLM-ready .txt Generator 
</h2>


Web2LLM is an ***open-source*** tool that converts any website into an optimized, AI-friendly context file (llm.txt). Perfect for generating training data for Large Language Models (LLMs), it stands out by being ***ultra-fast and highly accurate***  compared to other LLM content generators.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> ### Why I Built This ?
> While building my own **RAG AI system**, I struggled with converting websites into clean, LLM-ready `.txt` files.
>
> - Scraping required coding knowledge  
> - Extracted content was messy and unoptimized for LLMs  
> - Estimating token usage and cost was manual and confusing  
> - Non-AI teammates couldn’t help — leading to delays and poor results
>
> This made AI development slow, error-prone, and hard to scale across teams.
>
> ---
> 
> ### How I Solved the Problem ?
>
> So I created **Web2LLM** — a fast, open-source tool that:
> - Automatically scrapes WebPage and cleans websites  
> - Outputs clean `llm.txt` files ready for AI use  
> - Shows token count, file size, cost, and processing time  
>
> It’s built for both AI developers **and** non-tech users — so anyone can generate clean, structured data for AI projects in seconds.
